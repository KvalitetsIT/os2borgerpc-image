Creating a new BibOS image from scratch

    Start installing a vanilla Ubuntu system - Ubuntu 12.04 in the
    present example. Install on a virtual or physical machine 
    (BibOS also supports Ubuntu 14.04).

    Select the correct target language for installation - Danish if your
    users want to work in Danish.

    Create the initial user as Superuser - specify BibOS2 as host name.
    This is by convention, the initial user (sudo user) and host name
    can be whatever you want

    Enter the standard BibOS2 password (if you don't know it, ask
    someone or choose your own)

    Think about whether to select the option to encrypt the superuser's
    $HOME directory (current recommendation: Do NOT do this)

    To install bibos you need bibos_installation.sh file. Copy it to
    the superusers /home folder.

    If this installation is for a clonezilla image open the 
    bibos_installation.sh and remove the reboot command at line 59.

    Open a terminal,

    # Change execution rigths for the installation file. 
    
    sudo chmod +x bibos_installation.sh

    # Start the installation:
 
    ./bibos_installation.sh	

    Now the system is ready to be cloned as a Clonezilla image or 
    to be connected to the admin system.

    When the system is rebooted the system will log in as superuser so
    the "Færdiggør bibos installation" can be executed. 	 

    If it is for a CloneZilla image, boot up the system with a CloneZilla
    live CD and clone an image, e.g. to your own /home/partimag using SSHFS.
