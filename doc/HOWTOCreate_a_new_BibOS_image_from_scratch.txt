Creating a new BibOS image from scratch

    Start installing a vanilla Ubuntu system - Ubuntu 12.04 in the present example. Install on a virtual or physical machine

    Select the correct target language for installation - Danish if your users want to work in Danish.

    Create the initial user as Superuser - specify BibOS2 as host name. This is by convention, the initial user (sudo user) and host name can be whatever you want

    Enter the standard BibOS2 password (if you don't know it, ask someone or choose your own)

    Think about whether to select the option to encrypt the superuser's $HOME directory (current recommendation: Do NOT do this)

    Let the installation run its course - this may take some time

    Reboot the computer when prompted and log in with the user name and password you specified

    In a terminal, 
    
    sudo apt-get install git

    # Grab the source code:

    git clone https://github.com/magenta-aps/bibos_image.git

    # Go to the scripts folder:

    cd bibos/image/scripts

    # Create standard BibOS setup:

    ./bibos_setup.sh

    # Wait - this will update, upgrade and install a lot of packages

    # Reboot to complete installation process

    Perform necessary manual configuration - prepare the installation so everything is ready the way our customer wants

    When done, go to the scripts folder and finalize the image:

    cd bibos/image/scripts
    ./finalize.sh


    This will force the postinstall script to execute automatically next time the system is booted.

After executing finalize, the system is ready for cloning and inclusion in a CloneZilla image.

Boot up the system with a CloneZilla live CD and clone an image, e.g. to your own /home/partimag using SSHFS.
