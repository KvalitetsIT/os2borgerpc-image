Guide to saving an image of a harddisk prepared for BibOS installation

To save a harddisk for use in creating a BibOS install iso download a
clonezilla iso from http://clonezilla.org/ and boot it on the machine with
the harddisk.
Then follow the guide at

http://clonezilla.org/fine-print-live-doc.php?path=./clonezilla-live/doc/01_Save_disk_image/

but choose to save a single partition instead of the whole disk. The partition
you want to save is the main partition you installed Ubuntu on and is probably
called sda1.

Once the harddisk image is saved it can be used to create a new ISO by
following the guide to create a BibOS CD at
