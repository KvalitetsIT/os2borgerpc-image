Creating a new OS2borgerPC image from scratch

    Start installing a vanilla Ubuntu system - Ubuntu 20.04 in the
    present example. Install on a virtual or physical machine. If
    installing in a virtual machine, be sure to use UEFI boot - the
    install scripts currently don't handle images with legacy boot well
    (there is no trouble installing on machines with legacy boot,
    though).

    Select the correct target language for installation - Danish if your
    users want to work in Danish.

    Create the initial user as Superuser - specify BibOS2 as host name.
    This is by convention, the initial user (sudo user) and host name
    can be whatever you want

    Enter the standard OS2borgerPC password (if you don't know it, ask
    someone or choose your own).

    To install OS2borgerPC, you need the ``os2borgerpc_installation.sh``
    file. You'll find it in this repository, in
    ``image/scripts/os2borgerpc_installation.sh``. You can also read
    that file and perform the commands manually, step by step.

    If this installation is for a clonezilla image, you'll probably want
    to open ``os2borgerpc_installation.sh`` and remove the reboot
    command at line 41.

    # Change execution rights for the installation file. 
    
    Open a terminal,

    sudo chmod +x os2borgerpc_installation.sh

    # Start the installation:
 
    ./os2borgerpc_installation.sh	

    Now the system is ready to be cloned as a Clonezilla image or 
    to be connected to the admin system.

    When the system is rebooted the system will log in as superuser so
    the "Færdiggør os2borgerpc installation" can be executed. 	 

    If it is for a CloneZilla image, boot up the system with a CloneZilla
    live CD and clone an image, e.g. to your own /home/partimag using SSHFS.

    See the separate guide on how to do this.
