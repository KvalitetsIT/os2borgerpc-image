These are scripts which are developed as part of the BibOS admin system.

They are not intended as general purpose GNU/Linux scripts, but are written
specifically for the BibOS distribution. See the DOCUMENTATION.txt or
DOCUMENTATION.html files for more information about what they do (in Danish).

The scripts in the directory "diagnostics" are intended for debugging.
The scripts in the ubuntu folder should work on Ubuntu 12,14 and 16.04 LTS.
